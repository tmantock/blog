## My name is Tevin Mantock

I am a Software Developer. I build web applications for a living. Professionally, I work with PHP, MySQL, Apacahe, Drupal, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SASS. However, I like to use a wide array of other technologies for my personal projects, like Go, Rust, Python, Node.js, React, Angular, MongoDB, C, C++, and Meteor.

While most of my experience revolves around the web, I have found that I am more interested in other areas of Computer Science, like Artificial Intelligence, Embedded Systems, and Distributed Systems. In my spare time, I enjoy looking into these various topics and learning more about them.
