# Day Zero

Welcome to my blog! This is my very first post, and of course, it has to be a "Hello World!" post.

### Why have I chosen to start a blog?

I personally find listening and observing the experiences of others to be an important part of my personal learning and decision making. I often ask others about their life experience and advice about a certain topic to learn and make decisions about my own life. I don't follow their advice word for word (actually not at all), but I find it helpful to listen and think about different perspectives and outcomes to form my own opinion. However, I have found that I am currently in a unique position. A predicament that I find myself without any available resources to refer to.

### Some History

In order to understand my current predicament, it would be helpful to understand a little of my back story. I am Software Developer, and I absolutely love being a Developer and programming. I didn't go to school to for Computer Science. No. I went to school for Economics, because I enjoyed the topic, and I found that Economics came naturally to me. I never struggled in any of classes, and I thought that I would have a good life working in a job that related to Economics. After college, I ended up working as a Consultant, and realized what the real world is like outside of academia. I didn't like it. Everything that I studied meant nothing, as I wrote business reviews, analyzed data, and made recommendations. Once again, I didn't like it, but I did get really good at Excel. I decided that I enjoy the path that I was taking and wanted to make a change. I decided that I had two options:

    - Get an MBA
    - Go to Law School

Getting an MBA made sense, since I was already on the business career track, and the job description of some of the directors and executives that my company worked with were very interesting. Going to Law School made sense, since I've been interested in Law, especially Constitutional Law, ever since I was a freshman in college. However, after taking the LSAT and studying for the GMAT, people started to ask me, "What kind of lawyer do you what to be?" I would always say Tax Lawyer. It made sense to go for Tax Law. There's demand, you can make good money, and there's a decent amount of complexity to ensure you had some job security. That's when I realized it. That's when I realized just how big of a mistake I made. Demand, money, job security. In economic terms, all of that makes sense, but there was no passion. There was nothing in it for me besides the money. Well that's actually very debatable when you include the debt you'd have to incur. So I decided to take a break and truly think about what I enjoy in life. 

The first thing that came to my mind was technology and science. I remembered being a child watching Star Trek and Star Wars and just dreaming about being apart of either universe. However, I immideately rejected the idea. I was in business. I had a degree in Economics. I couldn't just go into science like that, so I kept on searching, and I couldn't come up with anything else. That's when I started to talk with one of my co-workers, who was going to school for their second bachelor's degree in computer science. We talked about the degree and the classes that they were taking, and that's when I realized that's what I wanted to do. Everyday, I would go home and watch videos about working as a programmer (mostly web), and I just knew that's what I want to do. I also thought about the dreams that I had as a child, and just how far drifted away from them. Eventually, I decided that I didn't like the way the game of life was set up for me. You have an Economics degree, therefore you can only business jobs. So, I flipped the table/game board. I didn't care. I was 22 years old at the time. I could hit the reset button and try again. However, I didn't know how I could do it, would I enjoy it, or if I'd be any good at it? I had three options:

    - Get a Master's of Computer Science
    - Get a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science
    - Go to a Coding BootCamp

I ended up choosing the BootCamp, because it required the least amount of money and total amount of time. A bachelor's would take two years, and my alma mater wasn't going to give financial aid for second bachelor's degree. It didn't make sense to go for a Master's degree, because I didn't know a single thing about computers and programming besides Microsoft Office and how to troubleshoot Windows. I wanted to make sure that I enjoyed it. I had taken some CodeAcademy courses on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and couldn't help but to be excited that I created something from nothing. I wanted to see if I liked working in the industry before I made a huge commitment like a Master's degree. I also knew that I wasn't interested in Web Development. Out of all the topics I talked about with my co-worker, not once did we talk about Web Development. However, Web Development was easy. It didn;t require a degree to get a job, so Id ecided to go with the BootCamp. Now that's a story for another day.
